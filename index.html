            The data to the right is an organized and graphed interpretation of the "Marine Microplastic Concentrations", tracked by the Nation Oceanic and Atmostpher Administration (NOAA). It reports the 160000+ cases of microplastic concentrations in 3 oceans, the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic. These graphs indicate not only the abundant amount of microplastic in our main oceans, but also 
            how more than half of the cases have quite a severe amount.</p>

Without recognizing, we've put our world in harmsway for us and the terrestrial animals, finding it harder and harder to find a clean source of water, and especially for the marine animals, who fall victim to the waste and oil spills.

Even from one section of the world, there were more than 200 REPORTED cases in the span of 3 years. These charts conclude that ships have been the #1 source of the polutant spills and they typically spill diesel and other forms of oil.[ The other listed in the graphs indicate more specific oils and forms of metals and garbage]</p>
